<body>
<p>This package is concerned with the deployment of CAS regardless of
configuration exceptions. The default Spring behavior is to fail fast on
deployment if there is an initialization exception. The classes in this
package override that ability. The application will deploy regardless.
However, when a user attempts to access the system, they will be
presented with an error message regarding access to the application.</p>
<p>These classes are useful in the case where Tomcat is not fronted by
Apache.</p>
