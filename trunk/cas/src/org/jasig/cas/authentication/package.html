<p>Authentication validates the Credentials provided during a /login
request. In this context, "Credentials" are an opaque object declared
with the Credentials marker interface. The AuthenticationManager 
typically passes the Credentials to a sequence of plug-in elements
to see if any of them can recognize and process the concrete implementing
type.</p>

<p>Successful authentication generates a Principal object wrapped in an
Authentication object. All these objects must be serializable, and the 
Authentication becomes part of the TGT in the ticket cache.</p>

<p>Unsucessful authentication must throw an AuthenticationException. The
AuthenticationManager may not return null to signal a failure.</p>
